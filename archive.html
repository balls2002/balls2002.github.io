<h3>08/07/2023</h3>
<p>The Union has cut their reception hours for the summer (austerity?) so we've decided to wrap up the year. 
Many thanks to everyone who's come to JACS this year and we'll be back as usual from Tuesday 26 September! Hope to see many of you then and have a great summer.</p>

<h3>09/06/2023</h3>
<p>Term 3 is done but we are not. Weekly sessions continue every Tuesday from 7-9pm until the Union forcibly removes us from the store room. 
In other news, your new Social Secretary Molly is organising a JACS trip to the <strong><a href="https://facebook.com/events/s/burn-on-the-beach-june-2023/572137508373234/" target="_blank">
Beach Burn</strong></a> on Saturday 16th and, on Sunday 18th from 1-5pm, we are hosting this year's <strong>National Juggling Varsity</strong> after a three-year plague hiatus!</p> 

<h3>14/05/2023</h3>
<p>After months of preparation, our merch is finally ready! These will go on sale from Tuesday 16th via the Union shop. If you've placed a pre-order with us, you can select the members' option and get the hoodies for £25. 
But quick! This is a time-limited offer that only lasts one week, after that all hoodies will be standardised to £30. For more information, check out our <a href="https://balls2002.github.io/merch.html">merch page</a>.</p>

<h3>05/05/2023</h3>
<p>We're excited to announce that we're jointly hosting an end-of-year <strong>Stylistic Sports Ball</strong> on Saturday 27 May from 7-11pm at the IOE Bar
alongside Calisthenics, Gymnastics, Parkour, Pole Fitness, and Skate! Dress code is formal(ish) and free drinks for the first 50 people to arrive! 
Tickets are £12 for members and £15 for any plus-ones. Click <a href="https://studentsunionucl.org/whats-on/events-activities/stylistic-sports-ball?v=66055" target="_blank">here</a> to get yours now.</p>
<h3>25/04/2023</h3>
<p>We're back for Term 3! Regular sessions resume every Tuesday 7-9pm as usual, and Fire Night is back as well this Friday 26 in the Main Quad... but we've packed a whole summer of events too.

<h3>17/03/2023</h3>
<p>Congratulations to Nick, Seth, Marian, Marina, Molly for winning their races to become the 2023/24 Clowncil!!</p>

<h3>06/03/2023</h3>
<p>Nominations for elections have now closed... be sure to attend our Annual General Meeting (AGM) this <strong>Friday 10 March from 5-7pm on the Portico</strong> where we will do candidate hustings in the style of a classic Port & Policy event, pioneered by everyone's least favourite clowns, the Conservative Society. We will be debating three policies which, depending on the outcome of these debates, will be put into our Constitution. Click <a href="https://mailchi.mp/ff6aedd3211f/ucl_balls-fuck-it-we-ball-15363754?e=5201b122c5" target="blank">here</a> for the agenda and more information about the AGM.</p>

<h3>22/02/2023</h3>
<p>It's that time of the month again... Fire Night is BACK this <strong>Friday 24 from 7-9pm on the Main Quad</strong>. If you're thinking of juggling or spinning with fire, please observe the dress code: natural fibres only, no dangly bits, and preferably (for your laundry's sake) something dark. But come by anyway even if you're sane enough to not play with literal fire! It'll be great to watch anyway and, just so nobody is left out, we'll also be bringing out our fancy LED kit!</p>

<h3>20/02/2023</h3>
<p>Your favourite piss-take society is doing elections! Nominations are open NOW for every committee role for 2023/24, so if you've been feeling like our shenanigans have gone too far this year and feel the need to intervene and topple the sitting clowncil then now is your chance. Click the <a href=about.html>about</a> page for a full list of positions. You can nominate yourself via <a href="https://studentsunionucl.org/clubs-societies/juggling-and-circus-society/elections">this link</a> until <strong>Monday 6 March</strong> if you would like to procrastinate. Candidates will be expected to attend our Port(ico) and Policy AGM on Friday 10 March, where you will be subjected to a humiliating grilling - more details to follow.</p>

<h3>11/02/2023</h3>
<p>We're making more merch! We've designed four fantastic jumpers/hoodies that will raise awkward questions in any setting outside of JACS, as well as a return of our fan-favourite t-shirt (with some modifications to hopefully pass Union censors). Register your interest today by filling in <a href="https://forms.gle/77RaQr5NDoE5TZWH7">this form</a>!</p>

<p>Massive thank you to everyone who came to watch our 20th anniversary show! We'll be putting pictures up on Instagram and on the photo album over the next few days.
</p>

<h3>16/01/2023</h3>
<p>Juggling is about to get a lot hotter... (this time for real)<br><br>

It was an incredibly long journey and an absolute emotional rollercoaster, but we're glad to say that we've finally secured <em>all</em> the right paperwork from the Union and UCL to hold our first Fire Night since 2020!! If you're a skilled juggler, this is your time to shine - literally. But if you're sane enough to not play with actual fire, we will also bring along our LED kit so nobody is left out. Join us on the Main Quad this Friday 20th from 6-8pm and we'll light some shit on fire!!</p>

<h3>09/01/2023</h3>
<p>We're kicking off the new term and the new year with a special announcement that we'll be holding a variety show titled <em>F**k It We Ball!</em> on 31 January to celebrate two decades of balling and clowning at UCL. For more information and ticketing, visit the Union website <a href="https://studentsunionucl.org/whats-on/clubs-societies/fk-it-we-ball-juggling-and-circus-20th-anniversary-variety-show?v=63941" target="_blank">here</a>. Apart from that, our regular weekly sessions resumes from Tuesday 10th!</p>

<h3>13/12/2022</h3>
<p>We're performing at the UCL Graters' Christmas show tonight in Mully's at 7pm! Entrance is 	&#163;3 at the door. Our regular Tuesday sessions will continue to run in parallel to this, so those of us who are not performing tonight will still be in the North Cloisters. Come join us for the last session of the term!<br>

<br>Separately, we're holding a referendum to amend the society constitution (again) per Union regulations, to introduce the new position of Master of Taverns (Social Secretary). You can vote to approve the changes <a href="https://studentsunionucl.org/election/juggling-and-circus-society-constitution-ammendment-referendum/do-you-approve-of-changes">here</a>. Hustings (PowerPoint Night) and by-elections will take place in term 2!</p>

<h3>07/12/2022</h3>
<p><del>Juggling is about to get a lot hotter... after 49 long and excruciating days, we've finally secured the official paperwork from the Union to hold our first <b>Fire Night</b> since 2020! Join us at <em>6-8pm this Friday 9th at Torrington Square</em> following our showcase at the Winter Arts Festival at 5pm!</del><br>

<br>Update: the Union coarsely forced us to cancel the Fire Night last minute due to venue limitations (that they did not tell us about in advance) with Torrington Square, which is owned by the University of London. We're working to get the necessary paperwork to use the venue for term 2.</p>

<h3>01/12/2022</h3>
<p>It's the <b>Winter Arts Festival!</b> We're performing on <em>Friday 9 December at 5pm in the Main Quad</em>, followed by an impromtu juggling session until 8pm, when we might head to the Arts Festival Afterparty at Phineas depending on vibes. Come join us!</p>

<h3>25/11/2022</h3>
<p>Congratulations to Seth for winning his race to become Master of Balls!</p>

<h3>14/11/2022</h3>
<p>We are holding our Term 1 By-Election Hustings for Master of Balls this <strong>Friday 18th</strong> at <strong>6pm</strong> in the <strong>South Quad Teaching Block 102</strong> in the form of a PowerPoint Night social!! Come watch even if you are not presenting. We are making all candidates and committee members do a presentation on some random stupid topic and it'll be funny. You can do a presentation as well if you come prepared with one!</p>
