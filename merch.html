        <p>This is the flagship JACS merch. With sizes avaliable in small, medium, and large, this bad boy sends a clear message to the world that you wield 'fuck it we ball' energy.
		Unfortunately, due to Union censorship rules we've had to censor the f-word. But it'll do the job.
		<br>
		<br>Just to drive the point home, on the back is a tweet that the Union probably regrets writing, saying 'er - you've used vital society funding for this? Bold'
		Damn right we are bold and screw you too for not giving us any funding for this because we went ahead and got our own sponsors.

        <p>Did you know that there is no water in milk? Milk is its own liquid, the secret 119th element on the periodic table, but the government doesn't want you to know
		about it. Why the hell do you think the US government currently holds a stockpile of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jan/10/america-cheese-surplus-production-dairy-farmers" target="_blank">
		1.4 billion pounds of cheese</a> in massive underground caves? They are gatekeeping this shit from us.
		<br>
		<br>Now that you know about the big milk conspiracy, it's time to wake the masses up. The people deserve the truth, and what better way to spread it than with a vibrant
		turquoise blue hoodie? Sizes available in medium and large.

        <p>The best way to finish a JACS Tuesday session is with a nice cold glass of pineapple juice. But the filthy capitalists at the Union always tries to slide in massive cubes of ice.
		The juice literally just came out of the fridge, so it is already chilled. The only reason they are giving you ice is so that they could give you less juice to help their margins.
		<br>
		<br>It's time to say no to ice. Liz Truss can trash the economy all she wants, but I draw the line at my half-pint of pineapple juice with no ice. Get yours today so you
		can turn up to the bar and be served without saying a word. Sizes available in medium only.

        <p>The Jester's Privilege is the right of clowns to speak and mock freely without being punished. As jesters of the modern day, we have assumed the mantle of this god-given
		right to <a href="https://twitter.com/ucl_jacs" target="_blank">Twitter dot com</a> to test just how far we can invoke this ancient recourse.
		<br>
		<br>But the woke left establishment wants to take this away from you. They are calling our tweets 'unprofessional' and a risk of 'reputational damage'. They seem to have forgotten that
		UCL prides itself on being disruptive thinkers, and we are simply disruptive tweeters. Get yours now to remind the wokerati that shitposting is a god-given right. Sizes available in small and medium.
